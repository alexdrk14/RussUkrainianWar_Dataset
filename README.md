# Russo Ukrainian War Collection of Tweet IDs
 
The repository contains an ongoing collection of tweets IDs associated with the current war between Russia and Ukraine, which we commenced collecting on Februrary 24, 2022. We leveraged Twitter's search API to extract historical tweets, leading our dataset to contain tweets from February 22, 2022. We utilize Twitter’s streaming API to collect dataset based on selected popular hashtags corelated to particullar topic. The list of selected hashtags is presented in "hashtags.txt" file. To comply with Twitter’s [Terms of Service](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy), we are only publicly releasing the Tweet IDs of the collected Tweets. The data is released for non-commercial research use.

## Data Organization
The Tweet-IDs are organized as follows:
* Tweet-ID files are stored in folders that indicate the year and month of the collection (YEAR-MONTH). 
* Individual Tweet-ID files contain a collection of Tweet IDs, and the file names all follow the same structure, with a prefix “tweet_ids_day_” followed by the YEAR_MONTH_DATE. 
* Note that Twitter returns Tweets in UTC, and thus all Tweet ID folders and file names are all in UTC as well.

* User Activity (Traffic volume)
